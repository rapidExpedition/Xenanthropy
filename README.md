**Xenanthropy** is the expression of human potential in the pursuit of enhancement therein.  As such, *Xenanthropism* posits that mastery of the human condition is best characterized by a state of perpetual growth.  It is a *philosophy of new humanity*, meant to formulate a means of achieving a permanent *Ã©tat extraordinaire*, both actively subordinating and seemingly alien to any given stage of greater human development.

Here, we will attempt to devise a system by which contemporary means of collaborative, iterative, and open development may be employed toward elucidation of xenanthropy.  To this end, we have a [repository hub](https://github.com/rapidExpedition/Xenanthropy/), its [wiki](https://github.com/rapidExpedition/Xenanthropy/wiki), and the focal point of it all, [a book](https://www.gitbook.com/book/rapidexpedition/xenanthropy/details).  In the interest of the proliferation and expansion of this body of work, it would behoove those interested in contributing to retrieve the whole of it by the following means:

```git clone --recursive https://github.com/rapidExpedition/Xenanthropy.git```

All others may find some interest in proceeding to further reading on the [Practice of Xenanthropy](https://rapidexpedition.gitbooks.io/xenanthropy/content/inPractice.html), as currently documented.  Note that this work will likely be in its infancy until some time to come, so feedback is also encouraged by the [means](https://www.gitbook.com/blog/features/discussions) of our [chosen platform](https://www.gitbook.com/).

Take note that though the manner of our documentation and development of this endeavor of philosophy may seem unorthodox, the very means and method of this is wholly congruent with a futurist proclivity (the *expeditionary mode*, in our terms), and xenanthropy is nothing if not a means of securing humanity's future.
