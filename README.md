Welcome to the home of xenanthropy, the philosophy of new humanity.  Here you will find the essential synopses comprising the [homepage](http://xenanthropy.com) for the front-end of xenanthropy, itself.  Note that it has been kept sparse in subject-matter, focusing on the [how](http://main.xenanthropy.com/pages/198373/), [why](http://main.xenanthropy.com/pages/515346) and [what](http://main.xenanthropy.com/pages/210939/) of xenanthropy.

On the technical side, we're utilizing [draft](https://draftin.com/) for editing and [draft sites](http://ninjasandrobots.com/draft-announcements-job-board-draft-sites-editor-flow-and-more#draft-sites) for hosting the master copies of these articles.  While the collaboration features of draft will serve for public, semi-casual inclusion in the development of this philosophy, we'll be using github to publicly track its development and provide the opportunity for credit in collaboration.  Github will also prove versatile if a different hosting scheme is used in the future.  Furthermore, we have the opportunity to utilize github's wiki feature to provide further elaboration.
