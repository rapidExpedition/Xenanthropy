#In Depth[^1]

By necessity xenanthropy must reflect and account for the deepest aspects of the human being.  It is our most subtle physicality that is the soil by which we cultivate the ideas driving us.  It is a fool's errand to attempt to account for all things all at once, however, so to explore the totality of an active system such as we are, we must engage the mode of thought experiment.  In our particular sort of thought experiment, we may follow cycles of thought to assess their origins, trajectory and outcome to assess the psyche as well as the life of the ideas it has absorbed.
